# MarkovBot

## Info
A Markov Chain Discord bot with the intention of impersonating members of the Discord server it is occupying. It uses from the ground up built markov chain and dictionary class to store the statistical messaging patterns of each member and the words they used, to approximate how they type -- much like modern smartphone keyboards auto-correct and word suggestion.

## TODO:

Better impersonaton
